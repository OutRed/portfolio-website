            <p>My internet name is OutRed, and yep, I'm still in school üìö. So, here's the scoop: I got into coding and web stuff back in middle school. Everybody was trying to play games on their school devices, but finding unblocked game sites was like finding a needle in a haystack. I promised my buddies I'd figure out how to make one. üéÆüïµÔ∏è</p>
            <p>Then, I stumbled upon GitHub and all these open-source game sites. I decided to play around with them and see what I could cook up and learn. After a week of tinkering with other people's web creations, I cracked the code on setting up a site using GitHub Pages, and created a website using markdown with various games. And boom! In April 2022, the OutRed game website came to life as my very first project. üöÄüåü</p>

        <p>I have a lot of other projects on my PC, but most of them will never be seen because they either aren't polished or finished. </p>

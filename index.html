        <p>If you are looking for the OutRed game website, click <a target="_blank" href="https://outred.org">here</a>. This website was originally a link for the <a target="_blank" href="https://outred.org">OutRed</a> game website, which is one of my projects. This website now showcases my projects.</p>

       <h1>Who is <h1 class="blue">OutRed</h1>?</h1>
       <p>
        My internet name is <p class="blue">OutRed</p>, and yep, I'm still in school üìö. So, here's the scoop: I got into coding and web stuff back in middle school. Everybody was trying to play games on their school devices, but finding unblocked game sites was like finding a needle in a haystack. I promised my buddies I'd figure out how to make one. üéÆüïµÔ∏è</p>
        <br>
        <p>Then, I stumbled upon GitHub and all these open-source game sites. I decided to play around with them and see what I could cook up and learn. After a week of tinkering with other people's web creations, I cracked the code on setting up a site using GitHub Pages, and created a website using markdown with various games. And boom! In April 2022, the OutRed game website came to life as my very first project. üöÄüåü</p>

                <p class="project-description">OutRed Games is an open source website featuring 400+ games and a fast web proxy. This was my first project, and my biggest project at the moment, and my only project I have monetized currently. This was very fun to work on, but with the most recent version, v4, I have decided to move on so I can work on other projects and expand my knowledge past static websites.</p>
